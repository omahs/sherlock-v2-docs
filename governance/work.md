# Work

SHER token holders are the ultimate backbone of the protocol. They will be held responsible for managing the risks as the SHER token will be included in the liquidation stack. On every payout a certain amount of SHER tokens will be minted to the `sherDistributionManager()`, potentially activating a multiplier for the rewards.

Because of this incentive, SHER holders are incentivized to manage the protocol well, this includes

- Voting on right mechanism to on-board protocols (on-boarding)
- Voting on right mechanism to ensure protocols stay safe during the coverage period & premiums stay up to date. (managing)
- Voting on right protocol parameters
- Voting on contract updates

It is not effective if the on-boarding and managing is done directly by the token holders, this power should be delegated to a smaller group and SHER holders should actively monitor the effectiveness of this team.

## Current mechanism

The current mechanism includes incentivizing Watsons to do a thorough security review and provide input to decide on the premium of the protocol.

## Voting power

The voting power will be based on the commitment to the protocol (similair to curve: https://resources.curve.fi/faq/vote-locking-boost)
